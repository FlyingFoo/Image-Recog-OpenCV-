# Image-Recog-OpenCV
A simple Python image recognition script written using OpenCV and matplotlib.

Comments for usability and understanding left in the code.
In the console you will see the x, y coordonates of the match printed as a tuple followed by a confidence value between 0 and 1.

Have fun! :)
